                        As an RSA Delivery Manager – AI Automations at Databricks India, I help customers accelerate innovation through Data + AI transformation powered by Delta Lake and modern Data Intelligence architectures. I have led the design and delivery of enterprise-scale, multi-agent AI frameworks, including for one of Europe's largest electrical organizations—driving significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and time-to-value. I have also architected agentic recruiting automation platforms and bring a proven track record of building, mentoring, and leading high-performing Data & AI teams to deliver business-critical outcomes.

                    <p>
                        I bring deep, hands-on expertise in cloud-native development across Databricks, AWS, and multi-cloud ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on scalable data architectures, reliability, and access controls. Known for strong customer obsession and a product-first mindset, I excel at translating complex business needs into actionable roadmaps and leading distributed teams to deliver measurable impact across analytics, automation, and AI-driven product initiatives.

                    <p>
                        Beyond my professional role, I actively write articles and create videos on leadership, Generative AI, and software development. I enjoy "vibe coding" and building mini-projects that push me technically and creatively. Passionate about teaching and mentoring, I regularly visit engineering colleges to share industry trends, guide students on career readiness, and help them prepare for real-world technology roles.

                        High-performing teams are not built by chance. They are the outcome of clear principles, intentional leadership, and disciplined execution. Over time, I've learned that sustainable performance emerges when trust, clarity, and ownership come before speed and short-term wins.
