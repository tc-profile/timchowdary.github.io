                        As an RSA Delivery Manager – AI Automations at Databricks India, I help customers accelerate innovation through Data + AI transformation powered by Delta Lake and modern Data Intelligence architectures. I have led the design and delivery of enterprise-scale, multi-agent AI frameworks, including for one of Europe's largest electrical organizations—driving significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and time-to-value. I have also architected agentic recruiting automation platforms and bring a proven track record of building, mentoring, and leading high-performing Data & AI teams to deliver business-critical outcomes.

                    <p>
                        I bring deep, hands-on expertise in cloud-native development across Databricks, AWS, and multi-cloud ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on scalable data architectures, reliability, and access controls. Known for strong customer obsession and a product-first mindset, I excel at translating complex business needs into actionable roadmaps and leading distributed teams to deliver measurable impact across analytics, automation, and AI-driven product initiatives.
